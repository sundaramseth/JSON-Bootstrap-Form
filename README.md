# JSON-Bootstrap-Form
The JSON Form library is a JavaScript client-side library that takes a structured data model defined using JSON Schema as input and returns a Bootstrap-friendly HTML form that matches the schema. The layout of the generated HTML form may be entirely fine-tuned through a simple declarative mechanism.
